In this directory I have uploaded the source codes of my 4 verilog projects and 9 basic verilog modules

## The 9 basic verilog modules in details are as follows:
1. sync_fifo
2. async_fifo
3. uart, implemented by hardware logic
4. uart_fsm, by fsm
5. iic_master
6. spi_master
7. uart2apb
8. apb2spi
9. ahb2apb

You can refer to this URL:  for design specs

## My 4 verilog projects are listed below :
1. bilinear interpolation RTL implementation
2. over exposure correction(OEC) alogrithm design and RTL implementation
3. memory controller
4. USB phy 1.1

Their design specs can be found in these URLs:
